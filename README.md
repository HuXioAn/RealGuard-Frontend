# RealGuard-Frontend
Frontend for [RealGuard Project](https://github.com/Hao-ran-Guo/RealGuard), in C# and Dotnet6!
> Please notice this **frontend** software is used to operate the RealSense camera and the door, and transfer the depth and ir data to backend via grpc calls.   
It acts as a data collector and an executor. And the UI for managing the control system is implemented in another project [**RealGuard-Web**](https://github.com/Leceue/RealGuard-Web).
>
Both front and back ends of this **RealGuard** project were fully tested on a Jetson Nano 4GB with Ubuntu18.
