# RealGuard-Frontend
Frontend for [RealGuard Project](https://github.com/Hao-ran-Guo/RealGuard), in C# and Dotnet6!
> Please notice this **frontend** software is used to manipulate the RealSense camera and the door, and tranfer the depth and ir data to backend via grpc calls.   
It acts as a data collector and an executor. And the UI for managing the control system is implemented in another project [**RealGuard-Web**]().
